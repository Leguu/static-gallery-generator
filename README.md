# Static Gallery Generator

Need an HTML file to display images and videos in a statically-served directory? This project is for you.

Usage:

```sh
cd public
generate-static-gallery > index.html
```

Done! When served as a static site, or if you open the HTML file directly, it'll show you all your images.
